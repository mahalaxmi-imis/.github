<p align=justify> The Integrated Municipal Information System (IMIS) is an open-source GIS-based Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) which functions as both a municipal information system and a software solution, integrating data, processes, and services to enhance municipal governance—particularly in sanitation management with Citywide Inclusive Sanitation (CWIS) approach to achieve SDG 6.2. It offers municipalities data-driven decision-making tools to strengthen governance across various sectors. By leveraging open-source technologies and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), it facilitates: </p>
• Planning, management, and monitoring of sanitation systems using the CWIS approach. </br>
•	End-to-end FSM (Faecal Sludge Management) service chain oversight, including real-time data tracking.  </br>
•	Generation and visualization of CWIS indicators for performance assessment. </br>
•	Intuitive dashboards for tracking CWIS indicators, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and other essential municipal governance metrics.  </br> </br>

<p align=justify> IMIS as a sub-national public data system contributes to national-level monitoring by feeding data into centralized systems, supporting CWIS indicators and other critical metrics for achieving sanitation targets. Beyond sanitation management, with its modular and scalable design, Base IMIS empowers local authorities by providing a unified, data-driven framework that enhances efficiency, accountability, and service delivery in municipal governance.  </p>

<p align=justify> IMIS features 10 functional modules (Fig 1): Building Information Management System (BIMS), Utility Information Management System (UIMS), Faecal Sludge Information Management System (FSIMS), Community/Public Toilet Information Management System (PTCTIMS), Sewer Connection Information Support System (SCISS), Public Health Information Support System (PHISS), and Urban Management Decision Support System (UMDSS), along with value-added modules for Property Tax Collection (PTCISS), Solid Waste (SWISS), and Water Supply (WSISS). These modules provide dashboards, spatial tools, and integration capabilities to with advanced dashboards for CWIS indicators and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to support evidence-based decision-making. Built on technologies like PHP and PostgreSQL and licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, IMIS fosters innovation in sanitation and urban governance, offering municipalities scalable, sustainable, and inclusive solutions. This repository provides the source code, installation guides, and documentation for deploying IMIS effectively. </p>
